# Smart Weather Monitoring & Forecasting

## Introduction

Our Project focuses on monitoring weather attributes such as rainfall,
pressure, humidity and temperature with the help of different sensors
and forecast from the data collected for future use. To forecast weather conditions from the data provided by real time
weather factors.
